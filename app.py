general_qa = {
    "what is edna": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) is genetic material shed by organisms into their environment (water, soil, or air). It allows monitoring species without capturing them.",
    "how can edna help monitor invasive species": "eDNA helps detect invasive species in water bodies early by analyzing genetic traces left in the environment.",
    "what are invasive fish species": "Invasive fish species in freshwater lakes include Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth bass), Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia), and Clarias gariepinus (African catfish).",
    "how do invasive species affect native fish": "Invasive species compete with native fish for resources, sometimes causing population declines or local extinctions.",
    "difference between invasive and native species": "Invasive species are non-native and can cause ecological or economic harm, whereas native species naturally occur in the ecosystem.",
    "how is dna extracted from water samples": "DNA is extracted from water samples using filtration, cell lysis, and purification methods to isolate genetic material for analysis.",
    "can edna detect rare species": "Yes, eDNA can detect rare or elusive species because even small traces of DNA are sufficient for detection.",
    "how reliable is edna analysis": "eDNA analysis is generally reliable but can be affected by DNA degradation, contamination, or sampling errors.",
    "methods to control invasive fish": "Common methods include physical removal, biological control, habitat management, and public awareness campaigns.",
    "why is biodiversity important": "Biodiversity ensures ecosystem stability, resilience, and provides resources for humans and other organisms."
